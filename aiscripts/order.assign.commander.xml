<!-- 
Basically the Fallback Mode.

Whenever a ship is assigned to another commander...
1. When Right Click API cannot be loaded
Do:
1. Check if the commander-to-be is a ship.
2. Check if both the commander-to-be and the subordinate-to-be have the same primary purpose
3. If [2] returns true, set the assignment to a value recognized by our other scripts (assignment.trade or assignment.mining)
-->
<!-- 
Update:
With Game v4.0+ available, the precondition [1] is impossible because we now rely on the [Mimic >] button to establish civilian fleets.
But, there is still a need for us to check civilian fleet names so we keep some of this code.
