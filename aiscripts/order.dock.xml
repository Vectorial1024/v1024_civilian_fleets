Note to self:
This script uses $thisship instead of $object, to account for the cases where
Betty docks for the player via Auto-Pilot.

                        Let's argue a bit.
                        For civ-fleet affected by this mod, they will receive proper default behaviors in the new sync code.
                        For non-civ-fleet members, they will fall back to vanilla behavior and gets assigned the Mimic Commander default behavior.
                        We have previously discovered that changing the default order does not affect the order queue at all;
                        ships will still try to finish their current orders before falling back to default behavior to generate new orders.
                        So, signalling the sync code here preserves correctness.
                        Performance problems and doubts will be put under the rug for simplicity.
