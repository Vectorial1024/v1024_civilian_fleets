## Quick Start Guide
You should check the Nexus page for more details, but, if you want to form/join a civilian fleet:

1. Set and confirm the default behavior of the fleet leader; the default behavior of the fleet leader will be applied to other members of the civilian fleet
2. Select and assign your other ships as "Mimic" role (refer to the attached pic above)
3. Setup complete
4. Forget about the fleet
5. ???
6. Profit.

## Requirements
- ~~Right Click API~~
  - No longer required! All things now rely on SirNukes Mod Supprot APIs, which is described below:
- SirNukes Mod Support APIs
  - Required: allows you to configure some parts of this mod
  - ~~Required: also allows adding the right-click menus~~ No longer used for this purpose since everything is now based on the Mimic assignment
